If you are upgrading from an earlier version, make sure you have a
backup of your existing database and files. At the minimum make sure
you don't overwrite your Web.config file. The existing Web.config
should work, but you might want to compare it with the new default.config to
see what has been added or removed. After upgrading you should
open install/default.aspx and your database should be automatically
updated.

1. Unzip to a folder available from your web server.

2. If you do not already have a "Web.Config" file, rename default.config
   to web.config. If you do have a "web.config", merge default.config 
   changes with it.

3. Open up "yafnet.config" and modify connstr to a valid database connection
   string for your SQL Server 2000/2005/Express database. The database that yaf
   points too should already exist.

3. If YetAnotherForum.net isn't installed at the root of your web
   server, make sure the files in the bin directory of the zip file
   is copied to /bin on your web server. Also you'll need to add the
   <root> element to the yafnet.config to point to the correct URL.
   Example: If you have install the forum in the directory "/forum/yaf/"
   you will need to add <root>/forum/yaf/</root> to web.config.

4. Open the file <YAFroot>install/default.aspx on your web site. If you
   are testing on your local computer, under a directory called
   YetAnotherForum.Net, the address should be:
   http://localhost/yetanotherforum.net/install/

5. Follow the directions and log in with the administration account
   you created during the setup.


NOTE: Url Rewriting is disable by default in this version to due to setup complexities for some users.
If you care about SEO for your forum, and are running YAF in a stand-alone configuration (non-DNN or Rainbow),
you can enable URL rewriting in yafnet.config by changing this line to true:

<enableurlrewriting>true</enableurlrewriting>
